# ðŸŽ’ Knapsack Problem

Impelentation using various algorithms of well known knapsack problem.


The algorithms are:

- Bruteforce 
- simple heuristic
- Dynamic programming


In the end relative error of the heuristic is returned, also program outputs times how much it takes to calculate problem instance.

# How to run

Repository contains testing knapsack data and referential solution data for comparison.

No libraries are needed, only default Python 3.7 instalation.
